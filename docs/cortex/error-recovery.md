# Error Recovery

> **STATUS: IMPLEMENTED**

How Cortex classifies, surfaces, and recovers from errors. Covers the error classifier module, auth failure detection, rate limit backoff, and integration with the 5-phase pipeline.

## Error Classification

Pi-ai surfaces all errors as plain `Error` objects with string messages. No error codes, no HTTP status codes, no structured types. The only structured detection pi-ai provides is `isContextOverflow()` (14+ provider-specific regex patterns).

Cortex implements a regex-based error classifier (`error-classifier.ts`) that maps error strings to actionable categories. This follows the same pattern pi-ai uses for context overflow detection, extended to cover other error types.

### Categories

Simplified to categories that are actionable at the framework level:

| Category | Severity | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `authentication` | fatal | Invalid API key, expired token, missing credentials |
| `rate_limit` | retry | Provider rate limit hit (429 equivalent) |
| `context_overflow` | recoverable | Context window exceeded. Handled by compaction. |
| `server_error` | retry | Provider 5xx or internal server error |
| `network` | retry | Connection failure, DNS resolution, timeout |
| `cancelled` | recoverable | Agent aborted by user or system |
| `unknown` | recoverable | Catch-all for unclassified errors |

Removed from the existing system (not actionable at the cortex level): `authorization`, `execution`, `resource_exhausted`, `not_found`, `invalid_input`, `unsupported`. These either don't apply to LLM calls or are too granular to classify from error strings.

### Classification Patterns

The classifier checks error strings against provider-specific regex patterns. Patterns are checked in priority order (first match wins).

**Authentication:**
```
/invalid.api.key/i
/unauthorized/i
/\b401\b/
/not.logged.in/i
/login.*required/i
/please.*log.?in/i
/authentication.required/i
/re-?authenticate/i
/expired.*token/i
/token.*expired/i
/token.*(revoked|invalid)/i
/refresh.*token/i
/oauth.*(fail|error|expire|invalid|denied|revoke)/i
/session.*expired/i
/invalid.*credentials/i
/api.key.*invalid/i
/permission.denied.*key/i
/Could not resolve API key/i
```

The `401`, `oauth`, `refresh.*token`, `token.*expired`, and `session.*expired` patterns cover OAuth access-token expiry where the refresh token is itself revoked or expired. In that case pi-ai's `getOAuthApiKey()` (invoked from the `getApiKey` callback) throws during credential resolution; the resolution error is surfaced as the cause rather than the downstream provider error (see "Auth Failure Detection").

**Rate Limit:**
```
/rate.limit/i
/too.many.requests/i
/429/
/rate_limit_exceeded/i
/throttl/i
/request.limit.reached/i
/quota.exceeded/i
```

**Context Overflow:**
Delegates to pi-ai's `isContextOverflow(message, contextWindow)` which already has 14+ patterns. Not duplicated in cortex.

**Server Error:**
```
/internal.server.error/i
/500/
/502.*bad.gateway/i
/503.*service.unavailable/i
/504.*gateway.timeout/i
/server.*error/i
/overloaded/i
```

**Network:**
```
/ECONNREFUSED/
/ENOTFOUND/
/ETIMEDOUT/
/ECONNRESET/
/network.*error/i
/fetch.failed/i
/socket.hang.up/i
/DNS.*resolution/i
/connection error/i
/timed out/i
```

The last two match the Anthropic SDK's canonical `APIConnectionError` ("Connection error.") and `APIConnectionTimeoutError` ("Request timed out.") messages, which the SDK throws after exhausting its own internal retries.

**Cancelled:**
Detected by checking `agent.state.error` after abort, or `stopReason === "aborted"` on the response.

### Classifier API

```typescript
interface ClassifiedError {
  category: ErrorCategory;
  severity: 'fatal' | 'retry' | 'recoverable';
  originalMessage: string;
  suggestedAction?: string;
}

function classifyError(error: Error | string, options?: ClassifyErrorOptions): ClassifiedError;

interface ClassifyErrorOptions {
  /** Context window size in tokens. Used for context overflow detection. */
  contextWindow?: number;
  /** Whether the agent was aborted (user or system cancellation). When true, the error is immediately classified as 'cancelled'. */
  wasAborted?: boolean;
}
```

The classifier is a pure function. It does not throw, does not modify state. It takes an error (or error string) and returns a classification.

**Suggested actions** per category:
- `authentication`: "Check your API key or re-authenticate in Settings."
- `rate_limit`: "Rate limit hit. The next tick will be delayed."
- `context_overflow`: "Context window exceeded. Compaction will run."
- `server_error`: "The provider is experiencing issues. Retrying."
- `network`: "Network error. Check your connection."
- `cancelled`: null (user-initiated, no action needed)
- `unknown`: null

## Error Event Flow

When a pi-ai call fails:

```
Pi-ai error (plain Error)
  → classifyError() produces ClassifiedError
  → AgentLoop emits onError(ClassifiedError) event
  → Consumer (backend) receives and routes:
      → Log the error (always)
      → EventBus 'system:error' (for auth, rate_limit, server_error)
      → Frontend receives via onSystemError tRPC subscription
      → SystemErrorCard rendered in conversation view
```

### AgentLoop Error Event

```typescript
cortexAgent.onError((error: ClassifiedError) => {
  // Consumer handles routing
});
```

This fires for any LLM call failure, whether it happens in the agentic loop (`prompt()`) or in a direct completion (`directComplete` / `structuredComplete` / `utilityComplete`, used for phases like THOUGHT and REFLECT). All four paths route failures through the same `emitError()` helper. Tool execution errors are not surfaced here; those are handled by pi-agent-core internally and don't crash the loop. A transient failure that a background retry recovers from never reaches `onError` (see [Transient error handling](#transient-error-handling)).

### Consumer Error Routing

Consumers receive classified errors and decide how to handle them (retry, notify users, escalate, delay). A typical consumer error handler routes errors to its own event/notification system:

```typescript
cortexAgent.onError((error) => {
  log.error(`Agent error [${error.category}]:`, error.originalMessage);

  if (error.category === 'authentication') {
    // Surface to UI, halt processing
    notifyUser({
      category: 'authentication',
      message: error.originalMessage,
      recoverable: false,
      suggestedAction: error.suggestedAction,
    });
  }

  if (error.category === 'rate_limit') {
    // Notify user, delay next operation
    notifyUser({
      category: 'rate_limit',
      message: error.originalMessage,
      recoverable: true,
      suggestedAction: error.suggestedAction,
    });
    scheduler.delayNext(backoffMs);  // see Rate Limit Backoff below
  }

  if (error.category === 'server_error') {
    // Notify user, may retry
    notifyUser({
      category: 'server_error',
      message: error.originalMessage,
      recoverable: true,
      suggestedAction: error.suggestedAction,
    });
  }
});
```

The consumer decides which categories warrant user notification, which trigger retries, and which are silently logged.

## Auth Failure Detection

Two detection points:

### Pre-Call (Credential Resolution)

The `getApiKey` callback (e.g. a consumer's `CortexCredentialService.resolveApiKey()`) throws if:
- No API key is configured for the provider
- The encrypted key cannot be decrypted (vault locked)
- An OAuth access token is expired and its refresh token is revoked/expired (refresh fails)

A resolution failure is remembered, not swallowed. The completion still attempts pi-ai's env-var fallback (so a consumer whose callback can't resolve but who has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set still works). If the call then fails, the remembered resolution error is surfaced as the cause (it is more actionable than the downstream provider error) and classified as `authentication` / `fatal`. In the agentic loop, pi-agent-core invokes `getApiKey` and stores the failure on `agent.state.errorMessage`, which `AgentLoop` re-throws and classifies the same way.

### Post-Call (Provider Rejection)

The LLM call fails with an auth error string (e.g., "Invalid API key"). The error classifier detects this via regex patterns.

### Auth Event

Both detection points result in the same consumer event. The backend emits `system:error` with `category: 'authentication'`, which the frontend renders as a SystemErrorCard with the suggested action to check API keys.

## Transient error handling

Cortex retries transient failures of a turn itself, in the background, before anything reaches `onError`. A turn that recovers never surfaces an error; the caller's `prompt()` promise just stays pending across the backoff window and resolves with the recovered result. Only a failure Cortex gives up on is classified, emitted through `onError`, and thrown.

### Why Cortex owns this

Provider-level retries exist but are inconsistent:
- **Anthropic SDK**: 2 retries (built-in)
- **OpenAI Codex**: 3 retries (custom in pi-ai)
- **OpenAI, Mistral, Google SDK**: SDK built-in (varies)
- **Groq, xAI, Cerebras, OpenRouter, etc.**: No retry at all

Pi-agent-core has no retry at the agent loop level. When an LLM call fails after provider-level retries are exhausted, the agent appends a synthetic assistant failure message (`stopReason: "error"`) and stops. Cortex sits above that inconsistent behavior, so it can apply one policy to every provider and resume the failed turn without re-running completed tool calls.

### Retry policy

`AgentLoopConfig.retryPolicy` takes a partial `RetryPolicy`, merged over the defaults by `resolveRetryPolicy()` (`src/retry-policy.ts`). `retryableCategories` and `backoffMs` replace the defaults wholesale when given; invalid values fall back to the default.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. `{ enabled: false }` turns background retry off. |
| `retryableCategories` | `['network', 'server_error', 'rate_limit']` | Categories eligible for retry. |
| `backoffMs` | `[120_000, 240_000, 480_000]` | Wait before each retry (2m, 4m, 8m). Entries past the end use `maxBackoffMs`. |
| `maxBackoffMs` | `600_000` | Cap on any single wait (10m). |
| `maxAttempts` | `20` | Retries before giving up (about a 3h window with the defaults). |
| `maxElapsedMs` | unset | Optional ceiling on time since the turn's first failure. |

### Mechanism

`TurnRunner` (`src/agent-loop/turn-runner.ts`) runs one logical turn under the loop gate:

1. The first attempt calls `agent.prompt()`. For a consumer turn the input is preceded by any parked wake deliveries and queued silent deliveries taken for this run. Pi catches provider errors and stores them in `state.errorMessage` without throwing, so the runner turns a set error state into a thrown error.
2. A failure is classified with `classifyError()`. A context overflow triggers emergency truncation first; it is not in the default retryable set, so it then surfaces.
3. The turn is retried only when `shouldRetry()` agrees (policy enabled, not aborted, severity not `fatal`, category retryable, attempts and elapsed time within the policy) and the transcript can be resumed: after trimming trailing failure stubs, the last message must be a user message or tool result past the slot region. A failure that lands after an assistant tool-call turn but before its results cannot be resumed and surfaces instead.
4. Before each wait the runner emits `onRetryScheduled`, then sleeps for `backoffForAttempt()`. The sleep wakes at once if the run is aborted.
5. After the wait it trims pi's failure stub and calls `agent.continue()`. The user message is already in the transcript, so nothing is re-sent and completed tool calls do not re-run.
6. A retry that succeeds emits `onRetrySucceeded`. A failure that will not be retried emits `onError` and rethrows. When the policy stopped a retryable category after at least one retry, `onRetryExhausted` fires first.

### Aborts

`isAborted()` is true when the run's abort controller fired or pi's run state holds an abort-shaped error. The match is on a word start ("abort", "cancelled"), so a network error such as `ECONNABORTED` stays a network error and keeps its retry.

- An abort during a backoff wait trims the failure stub, emits `onError` classified as `cancelled`, and throws an `AbortError` ("Prompt aborted during retry backoff") rather than the stale transient error.
- An aborted run that ends cleanly or with an error has its trailing aborted stub trimmed. A stub that carries partial text the user already saw is kept unless it also carries tool calls, which would be unpaired.
- A consumer turn whose controller was aborted before the turn left the gate queue never reaches pi: it emits a `cancelled` error and throws "Prompt aborted before it started".

### Failed delivery runs

Runs that deliver content without a consumer caller (background completions, parked wake deliveries swept into a run of their own) use the same retry loop with two differences:

- Their retry ladder is capped by a delivery budget: `maxElapsedMs` is lowered to what remains of the oldest item's budget, so re-attempts cannot re-enter the full ladder back to back.
- Per-attempt `onError` and `onRetryExhausted` are suppressed. A failed run is unwound from the transcript and re-attempted. `onError` fires once, at the root of the delivery chain, when content is dead-lettered after a failure or the failed run had progressed past it. A later attempt that delivers the content surfaces no error.

Content the loop gives up on is dead-lettered, never dropped silently. See [Background delivery budgets and dead letters](cortex-architecture.md#background-delivery-budgets-and-dead-letters) for the budgets, the unwind rules, and the dead-letter store.

Two related consumer-visible guarantees:

- A background delivery that fails after a consumer turn succeeded surfaces through `onError`. It never rejects that turn or replaces its error.
- Wake deliveries spliced into a consumer prompt that fails terminally are unwound and re-parked for a run of their own, unless the run progressed past them or was aborted.

### Events

| Hook | Payload | Fires |
|------|---------|-------|
| `onRetryScheduled(handler)` | `RetryScheduledInfo`: `category`, `attempt` (1-based), `maxAttempts`, `delayMs`, `nextAttemptAt`, `originalMessage`, optional `causeDetail` | Before each backoff wait |
| `onRetrySucceeded(handler)` | `RetrySucceededInfo`: `attempts` | When a retry resolves the turn |
| `onRetryExhausted(handler)` | `RetryExhaustedInfo`: `attempts`, `category` | When the policy stops retrying a retryable failure (consumer turns only) |
| `onError(handler)` | `ClassifiedError` | For any failure Cortex gives up on |

Every handler also receives the loop's `LoopOriginContext` as its second argument.

### Error categories and retry behavior

| Category | Severity | Retried by Cortex? | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| `rate_limit` | retry | Yes, by default | 429 or rate limit patterns |
| `server_error` | retry | Yes, by default | 500, 502, 503, 504 |
| `network` | retry | Yes, by default | Connection failure, DNS, timeout |
| `authentication` | fatal | No | Invalid key, expired token. Fatal errors are never retried, even if listed. |
| `context_overflow` | recoverable | No | Emergency truncation runs, then the error surfaces |
| `cancelled` | recoverable | No | User abort |
| `unknown` | recoverable | No | Unclassified errors, including a 404 |

### Interaction with provider-level retries

Provider SDKs retry inside each attempt, before the error reaches Cortex. Cortex's backoff starts only after those are spent.

The `maxRetryDelayMs` option in pi-ai caps provider-requested retry delays. If a server asks for a longer delay, pi-ai throws immediately rather than waiting, and Cortex's own backoff takes over.

## Consumer-Specific Rate Limit Handling

Consumers can apply higher-level backoff between prompts:

### Heartbeat Consumers (e.g., Animus)

For consumers with autonomous tick loops, rate limits should also delay the next tick:

```typescript
cortexAgent.onError((error) => {
  if (error.category === 'rate_limit') {
    consecutiveRateLimits++;
    const backoffMs = Math.min(
      30000 * Math.pow(2, consecutiveRateLimits - 1),
      300000  // max 5 minutes
    );
    tickQueue.delayNext(backoffMs);
  }
});

// On successful prompt completion
consecutiveRateLimits = 0;
```

### Interactive Consumers (e.g., Cortex Code)

For TUI consumers, `onError` can drive UI feedback:

```typescript
cortexAgent.onError((error) => {
  if (error.severity === 'retry') {
    tui.showError(`${error.suggestedAction} Send another message to retry.`);
  }
});
```

Interactive consumers usually avoid automatic retry loops so the user stays in control after the failure is shown.

## Integration with the 5-Phase Pipeline

Each phase of the pipeline (THOUGHT, AGENTIC LOOP, REFLECT) can fail independently. The error classifier runs on any failure. The per-phase failure handling sits above the classifier:

| Phase | On Error | Classification Used For |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| THOUGHT | Skip thought, continue to agentic loop with no thought in context | Log + surface to UI. Auth errors halt the tick. |
| AGENTIC LOOP | Cortex retries transient failures per its retry policy, then classifies the error and throws. Consumers decide whether to retry further, use partial results, or fall back. | Log + surface to UI. Auth errors halt the tick. |
| REFLECT | Retry up to 3 times. If all fail, skip reflection (emotions/decisions for this tick are lost). | Log + surface to UI. Auth errors halt the tick. |
| Any phase | If `authentication`: halt the tick entirely, surface to UI, do not retry. | Auth is always fatal. |

### Context Overflow During Agentic Loop

Detected via pi-ai's `isContextOverflow()`. Handled by the compaction system (see `compaction-strategy.md`):
1. Reactive compaction triggers
2. The loop retries with the compacted context
3. If compaction fails, the emergency truncation layer fires
