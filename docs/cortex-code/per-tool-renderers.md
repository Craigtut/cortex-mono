### 1. Mastra Code (github.com/mastra-ai/mastra, `mastracode/`)

Mastra Code uses pi-tui with a single monolithic `ToolExecutionComponentEnhanced` class that switches on tool name to dispatch to per-tool render methods. Source: `mastracode/src/tui/components/tool-execution-enhanced.ts`.

#### Architecture

- **One class, switch-based dispatch**: A single `ToolExecutionComponentEnhanced` container switches on tool name (`renderViewToolEnhanced`, `renderBashToolEnhanced`, `renderEditToolEnhanced`, etc.) to render each tool type differently.
- **Bordered box pattern**: Every tool renders inside a bordered box using Unicode box-drawing characters (`╭──` top, `│` side, `╰──` bottom). The footer line of the box contains the tool name, arguments summary, duration, and status icon.
- **Collapsible by default**: All tool results are collapsed by default. Ctrl+E toggles expand/collapse. Collapsed state shows a configurable number of lines (typically 15-20) with a "... N more lines (ctrl+e to expand)" indicator.
- **Streaming args**: Tool input arguments are streamed via `handleToolInputDelta`, which uses `partial-json` to parse incomplete JSON and update the component as args arrive. This means path and command display start appearing before execution begins.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks**: File paths are wrapped in OSC 8 terminal hyperlinks (`\x1b]8;;file://...\x07`) so they are clickable in supported terminals (iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty).

#### Per-Tool Rendering

**File Read (`view`)**:
- Pending: bordered box with just path display and spinner status
- Complete: bordered box with syntax-highlighted content (via `cli-highlight`), line numbers from the view range, file path as OSC 8 clickable link
- Collapsed: first 20 lines shown, "... N more lines" indicator
- Path is truncated from the beginning with ellipsis if too long for terminal width

**File Edit (`string_replace_lsp`)**:
- Pending with partial args: live diff preview as old_str and new_str stream in (shows tail of diff, scrolling new content in at bottom)
- Complete: colored diff (red for removed, green for added), windowed around first change with 3 lines of context before
- LSP diagnostics rendered below the box when available (error/warning/info with severity icons)
- Intra-line changes shown via color only (no inverse/bold highlighting)

**File Write (`write_file`)**:
- Streaming: syntax-highlighted content preview as file content streams in (shows tail, scrolling new lines in)
- Complete: full syntax-highlighted content in bordered box
- Same collapse/expand behavior as view tool

**Bash (`execute_command`)**:
- Streaming: live stdout appended to bordered box as it arrives via `appendStreamingOutput()`, with MAX_LINES=200 rolling window
- Trailing partial line buffered separately from complete lines
- Duration shown in footer after completion
- Exit code shown below box in error color for non-zero exits
- Error detection: checks both `isError` flag and regex pattern matching for common error strings
- Tail-aware: if command includes `| tail -N`, streaming output is limited to N lines to match final result

**Grep/Search**: No dedicated renderer. Falls through to generic tool rendering.

**File Listing (`find_files`)**:
- Bordered box with tree-like output from the file system
- Extracts summary line ("5 directories, 9 files") from output for the footer
- Collapsed to 15 lines by default

**Web Search**:
- Has a dedicated `renderWebSearchEnhanced()` method
- Shows search query and results in bordered box

**Sub-Agent**:
- Dedicated `SubagentExecutionComponent` class with its own bordered box
- Shows task description (word-wrapped, capped at 5 lines when collapsed)
- Rolling window of tool calls within the sub-agent (MAX_ACTIVITY_LINES=15)
- Each nested tool call shows: status icon + tool name + args summary
- Separator line between task description and activity list
- Footer shows: agent type, model ID, duration, status icon
- `collapseOnComplete` option collapses to single footer line after completion

#### Styling

- Background colors set via theme (`toolPendingBg`, `toolErrorBg`, `toolSuccessBg`) on the Box component
- Status indicators: `⋯` (muted) while running, `✓` (green) on success, `✗` (red) on error
- Duration formatted as ms/s/min
- Tool title in bold, args in muted/accent colors

### 2. pi-coding-agent (github.com/badlogic/pi-mono, `packages/coding-agent/`)

The pi-coding-agent uses pi-tui with a fundamentally different architecture: a **pluggable renderer system** where each tool definition provides its own `renderCall` and `renderResult` functions.

#### Architecture

- **Tool Definition with Renderers**: Each tool exports a `ToolDefinition` that includes `renderCall(args, theme, context)` and `renderResult(result, options, theme, context)` functions alongside the execution logic.
- **Extension-overridable**: Any extension can replace the built-in tool renderers by re-registering the tool with custom render functions while delegating execution to the original.
- **ToolExecutionComponent**: A generic container that delegates to `callRenderer` and `resultRenderer` from the tool definition. Falls back to generic display (tool name + JSON args) when no renderer exists.
- **Separate BashExecutionComponent**: Bash gets its own dedicated component class with streaming output, live loader, and dynamic borders.
- **Background color state**: The component box background color changes based on state: pending (dim), success (green tint), error (red tint).

#### Per-Tool Rendering

**File Read**:
- Call: `read path/to/file:offset-end` with path in accent color, range in warning color
- Result: syntax-highlighted content (via `highlightCode` function that understands file extensions)
- Collapsed: 10 lines, with "(N more lines, [key] to expand)" hint
- Truncation info shown when file was too large
- Supports image files: renders images inline using Kitty/iTerm2 protocol

**File Edit**:
- Call: `edit path/to/file` with optional edit count
- Result: word-level intra-line diff using the `diff` npm package
  - Removed text: red with inverse styling on changed tokens
  - Added text: green with inverse styling on changed tokens
  - Context lines: dim/gray
- Diff is generated from the tool's `details.diff` field (unified diff format)
- Line numbers included in the diff output
- Tabs replaced with spaces for consistent rendering

**File Write**:
- Call: `write path/to/file (N lines)` showing line count from content
- Streaming: syntax-highlighted content preview with incremental highlighting (first 50 lines get full multi-line highlight, rest get per-line highlight for performance)
- Result: "Written" on success, error message on failure
- Highlight cache maintained across updates to avoid re-highlighting unchanged prefix

**Bash**:
- Dedicated `BashExecutionComponent` with `DynamicBorder` wrapper
- Streaming: live output appended via `appendOutput()`, stripped of ANSI codes
- Loader component with spinner while running, showing cancel keybinding hint
- Collapsed: 20-line preview (PREVIEW_LINES constant), width-aware visual truncation
- Expanded: shows all available lines
- Status line shows: hidden line count, cancelled/error status, truncation warning with path to full output file
- Different border color for excluded-from-context commands (!! prefix)

**Grep**:
- Call: `grep /pattern/ in path (glob, limit N)` with pattern in accent, path in output color
- Result: match output as text, collapsed to 10 lines
- Shows match limit indicator and truncation info
- No special syntax highlighting on results

**Find/Glob**:
- Call: `find pattern in path (limit N)`
- Result: file list as text, collapsed to 10 lines
- Shows result limit and truncation info

**Web Search**: No built-in renderer (falls through to generic).

**Sub-Agent**: Not a built-in concept in pi-coding-agent at the tool level.

#### Key Design Pattern: Expandable Results

Every tool result follows the same expand/collapse pattern controlled by the `ToolRenderResultOptions.expanded` boolean. The `keyHint()` function renders the expand keybinding inline as a styled hint. This is consistent across all tools.

### 3. Anthropic CLI

Anthropic's CLI agent was built on a custom fork of Ink (React-based terminal rendering). While not open-source, details are available from the March 2026 source disclosure and public documentation.

#### Architecture

- **React component tree**: Every UI element is a React component rendered via a custom Ink reconciler
- **Virtual DOM**: Terminal "nodes" (Box, Text) are reconciled and diffed against the previous frame
- **Custom Yoga layout**: Full Flexbox layout engine ported to TypeScript
- **Collapsible tool output blocks**: Standard component for all tool results with streaming status
- **Word-level diffs**: `StructuredDiffFallback` component for edit operations
- **Syntax highlighting**: `HighlightedCodeFallback` with LRU cache for performance
- **Optimized rendering**: Cursor position tracking, ANSI code deduplication, EL sequences for SSH performance

#### Per-Tool Rendering (from public documentation and leaked source analysis)

**File Read**:
- Shows file path and line count in collapsed view
- Syntax highlighted content when expanded
- Line numbers displayed
- Truncation indicator for large files

**File Edit**:
- Collapsed: shows file path, line range, and change summary (e.g., "+5 -3")
- Expanded: unified diff with word-level highlighting on changed tokens
- Green checkmark on success, red X on failure

**File Write**:
- Shows file path and status
- Content preview when expanded

**Bash/Shell**:
- Real-time streaming of stdout/stderr
- Spinner animation while running
- Exit code and duration on completion
- Output collapsed by default with expand capability
- Truncated output for very long commands

**Grep/Search**:
- Match count in collapsed summary
- Grouped by file with context lines when expanded

**Glob/File Listing**:
- File count in summary
- Flat list when expanded

**Sub-Agent**:
- Shows nested tool calls as indented items
- Progress indicator while running
- Summary (tool count, token usage) on completion

#### Key Design Choices

- Background colors per status state (pending/success/error)
- Consistent collapse/expand across all tools
- Duration tracking on all tool calls
- File paths as clickable hyperlinks in supported terminals

### 4. Codex (OpenAI, github.com/openai/codex, `codex-rs/`)

Codex uses ratatui (Rust) for its TUI, with a fundamentally different approach based on "history cells" and "exec cells".

#### Architecture

- **History cells**: Each conversation event (user message, assistant message, tool call, etc.) is a `HistoryCell` trait object that produces `Vec<Line<'static>>` for display
- **ExecCell grouping**: Multiple related read/list/search commands are grouped into an "exploring" cell, displayed as a single collapsed block
- **Parsed command types**: Commands are parsed into `ParsedCommand` variants (Read, ListFiles, Search, Unknown) to drive rendering
- **Streaming controller**: A `StreamController` manages newline-gated streaming with animation (lines are queued and committed one-at-a-time for a typewriter effect)
- **Theme-aware diffs**: Diff backgrounds adapt to terminal background lightness (dark vs light theme auto-detection)
- **Multiple color level support**: Truecolor, 256-color, and 16-color palettes for diffs

#### Per-Tool Rendering

**Exploring Group (Read/List/Search)**:
- Multiple read-only commands grouped under a single "Exploring" / "Explored" header
- Active: shimmer-animated bullet + "Exploring" in bold
- Complete: dim bullet + "Explored" in bold
- Consecutive Read commands are merged into a single line: `Read file1, file2, file3`
- ListFiles: `List path`
- Search: `Search query in path`
- All items indented under `└` tree prefix
- No output content shown (purely structural summary)

**Single Command (Bash)**:
- Header: bullet + "Running"/"Ran"/"You ran" + syntax-highlighted bash command
- Bash commands are syntax-highlighted using a dedicated `highlight_bash_to_lines` function
- Output: dimmed text, head+tail truncation with "... +N lines" ellipsis in the middle
- Default limit: 5 lines for agent commands, 50 for user shell commands
- Output lines are ANSI-escaped (preserving terminal colors from command output)
- Status: green bullet on success, red bullet on failure
- Duration shown on completion
- "(no output)" in dim text when command produces no output

**Diff Rendering** (separate from exec cells):
- Dedicated `diff_render.rs` module for file change visualization
- Three `FileChange` variants: Add, Delete, Update
- Line numbers right-aligned with gutter sign (+/-/space)
- Syntax highlighting preserved within hunks (cross-line parser state maintained per hunk)
- Dark theme: muted green (`#213A2B`) and red (`#4A221D`) backgrounds
- Light theme: GitHub-style pastels (`#dafbe1` green, `#ffebe9` red)
- Word-level wrapping with style preservation across splits
- Separate gutter background colors for line numbers on light themes

**Spinner/Animation**:
- Truecolor: shimmer animation on bullet character
- Fallback: alternating bullet/circle dim blink (600ms interval)
- Animation can be disabled

#### Key Design Choices

- **Grouping over individual display**: read/list/search commands are grouped as "exploring" rather than shown individually
- **Head+tail truncation**: shows first N and last N lines with ellipsis, not just head or tail
- **No expand/collapse interaction**: output is statically truncated (no user-driven expand)
- **Viewport-aware line counting**: uses `Paragraph::line_count` with wrap to measure actual rows, not logical lines
- **Adaptive wrapping**: long lines are wrapped at column boundaries with style preservation

## Best Practices

### Patterns That Work Well Across All Agents

1. **Bordered boxes for tool output**: Mastra Code's bordered box pattern (`╭──`/`│`/`╰──` with footer summary) is the most visually clean and information-dense approach. The pi-coding-agent and Anthropic's CLI use background color blocks instead, which can be harder to distinguish at a glance.

2. **Streaming args display**: Both Mastra Code and pi-coding-agent stream partial tool arguments as they arrive, so the user sees the file path or command before execution begins. This significantly improves perceived responsiveness.

3. **Collapsible results with consistent keybinding**: All agents except Codex support expand/collapse. The pi-coding-agent's approach of embedding the keybinding hint inline ("(N more lines, [key] to expand)") is the most discoverable.

4. **Per-tool call rendering during streaming**: Showing the tool call header (tool name + key args) immediately when the tool starts, before results arrive, tells the user what is happening without waiting for completion.

5. **Syntax highlighting on file content**: All agents apply syntax highlighting to file read/write content. The pi-coding-agent's approach of caching highlights and doing incremental updates for streaming is the most performance-conscious.

6. **Word-level intra-line diff highlighting**: Both pi-coding-agent and Codex highlight the specific changed words/tokens within modified lines (using inverse styling or background color). This is significantly more useful than line-level coloring alone.

7. **File paths as OSC 8 hyperlinks**: Mastra Code wraps file paths in OSC 8 hyperlinks for click-to-open in supported terminals. This is a small addition with high UX value.

8. **Head+tail truncation for shell output**: Codex's approach of showing the first N and last N lines of output (with an ellipsis in the middle) is better than showing only the tail, because error context often appears at the top of output.

9. **Grouping read-only commands**: Codex's "Exploring" pattern that merges consecutive read/list/search commands into a single visual block is excellent for reducing noise during exploration phases.

10. **Duration tracking**: All agents track and display execution duration. This is essential for identifying slow operations.

### Patterns to Avoid

1. **No expand/collapse**: Codex's static truncation with no user-driven expansion is limiting. Users frequently need to see full output.

2. **Generic JSON dump for unknown tools**: When no renderer exists, showing raw JSON args and result text (as the pi-coding-agent fallback does) is acceptable but could be improved.

3. **Monolithic switch statement**: Mastra Code's single 1000+ line class with a switch on tool name is hard to maintain. The pi-coding-agent's pluggable renderer approach is better architecture.

## Recommended Design

### Design Principles

1. **Bordered box is the universal container**: Every tool result renders inside a bordered box with a footer summary line. This creates consistent visual rhythm.
2. **Pluggable per-tool renderers**: Each tool defines its own renderer functions (call + result), following the pi-coding-agent pattern. Unknown tools fall back to a generic renderer.
3. **Streaming from the start**: Tool components appear as soon as tool input streaming begins, updating progressively as args and results arrive.
4. **Collapse by default, expand on demand**: All tool results are collapsed by default. Ctrl+E toggles. Collapsed state shows enough context to understand what happened.
5. **Consistent status indicators**: `⋯` (running), `✓` (success), `✗` (error) in the footer of every tool box.

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture: Pluggable Renderer Registry

```typescript
interface ToolRenderer {
  /** Render the tool call header (shown immediately when tool starts) */
  renderCall(args: unknown, context: ToolRenderContext): ToolCallDisplay;
  /** Render the tool result (shown after completion or during streaming) */
  renderResult(result: ToolResult, context: ToolRenderContext): ToolResultDisplay;
}

interface ToolCallDisplay {
  /** Lines to show inside the bordered box (above the footer) */
  contentLines: string[];
  /** The footer summary: tool name + args summary */
  footerText: string;
}

interface ToolResultDisplay {
  /** Lines to show inside the bordered box */
  contentLines: string[];
  /** Updated footer text (may include duration, match count, etc.) */
  footerText: string;
  /** Lines to show below the box (e.g., LSP diagnostics) */
  belowBoxLines?: string[];
}

interface ToolRenderContext {
  expanded: boolean;
  isPartial: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
  termWidth: number;
  maxContentWidth: number; // termWidth minus border and indent
  theme: Theme;
  streamingOutput?: string; // For bash streaming
  duration?: number;
}
```

    - MCP namespace display

**Phase 4: Polish (1-2 days)**

14. Streaming args integration
    - Wire up `partial-json` parsing for streaming tool input
    - Update call display as args arrive

15. Duration tracking
    - Start timer on tool_start, stop on tool_end
    - Format and display in footer

16. Global expand/collapse toggle
    - Ctrl+E toggles the focused/most-recent tool
    - Track expanded state per tool call ID

### Estimated Total Complexity

| Phase | Days | Risk |
|-------|------|------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 2-3 | Low (well-understood patterns) |
| Phase 2: Core renderers | 3-4 | Medium (diff rendering, streaming) |
| Phase 3: Secondary renderers | 2-3 | Low (variations on established patterns) |
| Phase 4: Polish | 1-2 | Low |
| **Total** | **8-12** | |

The main risk is in the streaming bash output integration, which requires careful coordination between the tool execution event pipeline and the TUI component lifecycle.

## Streaming Considerations

### Which Tools Benefit from Streaming Renders

| Tool | Streaming Value | Approach |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Bash/Shell | **Critical** | Real-time stdout/stderr appending. Users need to see command progress live. |
| File Write | **High** | Content preview as it streams in. Shows what is being written before completion. |
| File Edit | **High** | Diff preview as old_str/new_str stream in. Shows what will change before execution. |
| Sub-Agent | **High** | Nested tool call activity list updates as sub-agent works. |
| File Read | **Low** | Result arrives all at once after file read completes. Streaming adds little value. |
| Grep/Search | **Low** | Results arrive all at once. No benefit from partial display. |
| Glob/File Listing | **None** | Instant completion. No streaming needed. |
| Web Fetch | **Low** | Could show HTTP status before body, but body arrives quickly. |

### Streaming Implementation Strategy

**Tier 1: Real-time streaming (bash)**
- Tool emits `shell_output` events with stdout/stderr chunks
- Component appends to rolling buffer, rebuilds display on each chunk
- Uses `requestRender()` to trigger TUI repaint

**Tier 2: Args-based progressive rendering (edit, write)**
- Tool input arguments stream via `tool_input_delta` events
- Component parses partial JSON with `partial-json`
- Rebuilds call display as path, content, old_str, new_str become available
- For write: shows syntax-highlighted content as it arrives
- For edit: shows diff preview as both strings become available

**Tier 3: Activity tracking (sub-agent)**
- Sub-agent emits tool_start/tool_end events for nested calls
- Component maintains activity list, updates on each event
- Rolling window of recent activity (oldest entries scroll off)

**Tier 4: Completion-only rendering (read, grep, glob, web fetch)**
- Show pending state (footer with ⋯) until result arrives
- Render full result on completion
- No intermediate updates needed

### Performance Considerations

1. **Rebuild throttling**: For bash streaming, cap rebuilds to ~10/second to avoid excessive rendering. Buffer chunks and rebuild on a 100ms debounce.

2. **Highlight caching**: Cache syntax-highlighted output keyed on (content hash, language). For streaming write, use incremental highlighting (highlight new lines only, not full content).

3. **Line truncation at width**: Always truncate content lines to terminal width minus border characters. This prevents soft-wrapping which doubles the effective line count and breaks the bordered box alignment.

4. **ANSI passthrough**: For bash output, preserve ANSI color codes from the command. Use `strip-ansi` only for width calculations, not for display.

5. **Partial JSON parsing**: The `partial-json` package can throw on malformed input. Wrap all parse calls in try/catch and silently ignore failures (the next delta will usually fix the parse).
