/**
 * Which stored credential answers a getApiKey(provider) call.
 *
 * pi-agent-core asks for the *model's* provider field, which is the synthetic
 * id "custom" for anything built by createCustomModel (Ollama, a local
 * OpenAI-compatible endpoint). The session answers those from the store, with
 * a fallback to the session's own provider name because a custom endpoint's
 * credential is filed under the connection name rather than "custom".
 *
 * That fallback is only safe while the two names describe the same endpoint.
 * A duplex talker outlives a /model provider switch still pointed at the
 * startup provider's model, so it keeps asking for "custom" long after the
 * session moved to a cloud provider, and the fallback then offers it that
 * provider's OAuth credential. Sending a cloud token to localhost is the real
 * hazard; the visible symptom was narrower, because an OAuth credential can
 * only be resolved under its own provider id and no OAuth provider is
 * registered as "custom".
 *
 * The callback under test is the one the facade is actually handed
 * (buildAgentConfig().getApiKey), not a private method reached directly, so
 * the wiring is covered along with the resolution.
