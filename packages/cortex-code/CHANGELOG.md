# Changelog

All notable changes to `@animus-labs/cortex-code` are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Fix permission prompt ordering: tool and network asks now take the prompt lock in arrival order, so a stream of network asks can no longer starve a waiting tool ask, and a late or repeated lock release can no longer free another prompt's lock.

## 0.6.0

- Use Cortex's native Ollama integration for interactive sessions and `complete`, with context allocation settings and runtime diagnostics. Existing Ollama credentials remain supported; the server must run Ollama `0.15.0` or newer.
- Require Cortex `^0.6.0`, including its built-in sandbox implementation. Delegate sandbox policy, initialization, network wiring, and cleanup to Cortex.
- Add optional duplex mode through `--duplex` and `agentMode`; the CLI keeps single-loop mode as its default.
- Add OS sandbox integration, `/sandbox`, enforcement status, network-access prompts, and per-command escalation. macOS/Linux default to the workspace policy; Windows containment remains opt-in and requires a separately supplied helper binary.
- Harden in-process file permissions, protected configuration paths, credential handling, and per-session temporary directories. Add `sandbox.requireEnforcement` to refuse shell execution when containment is unavailable.
- Fix OAuth refresh races, custom-endpoint credential isolation, setup input and repainting, and internal-tag display.
- Upgrade pi-ai and pi-tui from the published `0.80.3` baseline to `0.85.1`. Default rendering behavior is unchanged; pi-tui no longer reads `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR` or `PI_CLEAR_ON_SHRINK`, and its redraw debug variable is now `PI_TUI_DEBUG_REDRAW`.
- Breaking: session files moved to a composite artifact, and the move is one-way.
  A session now saves as `state.json`, which carries the session log, both
  agent loops' histories, observational memory and per-loop usage. The old
  pair (`history.json` plus `observations.json`) is still read, so existing
  sessions resume untouched, but sessions written by this version are not
  readable by an earlier build: downgrading and running `/resume` on one
  reports "Session not found". The durable `transcript.jsonl` is unaffected
  and stays readable by anything.
- Sessions are written to disk at startup and at every turn boundary, so a
  crash during a long task no longer loses the session.

## 0.5.0

- Show compact in-place retry status and surface error cause details.
- Answer permission prompts out of band through a control file.
- Show edited file paths under collapsed change groups.
- Add durable session transcript logging.
- Collapse tool display into a borderless activity stream.
- Add a lightweight complete command.
- Rebrand the TUI and OAuth callback page.
- Bundle brand assets through `tsup` and declare the `pi-ai` dependency.
