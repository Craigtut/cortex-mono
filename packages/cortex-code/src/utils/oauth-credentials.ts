 * the rest get invalid_grant. Intra-process bursts are collapsed by the caller's
 * single-flight, but separate processes (several interactive sessions, or
 * `cortex -p` runs resuming at once) can't share that. So when our refresh
 * fails, we re-read the credential store; if a concurrent winner has already
 * persisted a fresh credential, we retry with it instead of surfacing the
 * failure. A failure with no newer stored credential is genuine and rethrown.
