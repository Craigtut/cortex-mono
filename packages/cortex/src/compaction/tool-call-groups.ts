/**
 * Structural grouping of tool call messages with their tool results.
 *
 * In real pi conversations, one assistant message may carry N parallel
 * 'toolCall' content blocks; pi-agent-core then appends N separate
 * role 'toolResult' messages (one per call, in order). Providers require
 * every tool call to have a matching result and every result to have a
 * preceding matching call, so the assistant message plus its consecutive
 * toolResult messages form ONE atomic unit for compaction purposes:
 *
 *   - Layer 2 (summarization) must never split the preserved-tail boundary
 *     inside a group.
 *   - Layer 3 (emergency truncation) must drop the whole group or none of it.
 *
 * Orphaning either side corrupts the conversation: an orphaned toolResult
 * (result without its call) is a hard provider 400; an orphaned toolCall
 * gets a synthetic "No result provided" error injected by pi-ai.

/**
 * Find atomic tool call groups in conversation history.

 * A group is a contiguous run of messages: one assistant message containing
 * 'toolCall' blocks followed by its consecutive toolResult messages.
 *
 * Every contiguous toolResult message after an assistant tool-call message is
 * swept into the group, including one whose ID does not match any of the
 * assistant's calls. Providers place a result immediately after its call, so a
 * contiguous run of results structurally belongs to the preceding call message.
 * Ending the group early on a foreign ID (which cannot arise from well-formed
 * pi history) would strand a later, genuinely-matched result as its own head,
 * so the group is kept whole instead.
 *
 * Returns a map from every message index that belongs to a group to the full
 * ascending list of indices in that group. Indices within a group are always
 * contiguous. Messages outside any group are absent from the map.
