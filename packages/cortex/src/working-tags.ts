/**
 * Working tags parser.
 *
 * Separates agent text into user-facing and working (internal reasoning)
 * content based on <working> XML tag delimiters.
 *
 * Parsing rules:
 * - Tags are flat delimiters: <working> opens, </working> closes. No nesting.
 * - Multiple <working> blocks are concatenated (newline-separated) in `working`.
 * - Whitespace between closing </working> tag and subsequent text is normalized.
 * - Unclosed <working> tag: all content after the opening tag is treated as working.
 * - Simple regex, not a full XML parser.
 *
 * `<thinking>` is accepted as an alias everywhere `<working>` is: models with
 * reasoning disabled routinely fall back to their trained scratchpad tag
 * instead of the prompted one (observed on the duplex talker, which runs
 * thinkingLevel 'off' and does its thinking in-band), and an unrecognized
 * delimiter leaks the reasoning verbatim to the consumer. The alias list is
 * deliberately short and explicit; stripping unknown XML generically would
 * eat legitimate quoted content.

 * - `push(chunk)` returns the text safe to emit now. Text from any `<` is

 * - Inside a working block, content is suppressed until `</working>`
 *   closes it (a completed block emits one newline, matching
 *   stripWorkingTags' sentinel so words on either side never jam together).
 * - `flush()` at stream end releases a held prefix that never became a tag
 *   (a trailing `<` IS emitted) and drops unterminated working content
 *   (matching stripWorkingTags' unclosed-tag rule). flush() is synchronous
 *   and unconditional: there is nothing to deadlock on when a close tag
 *   never arrives, because nothing ever waits; text is merely held until
