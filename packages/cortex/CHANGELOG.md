# Changelog

All notable changes to `@animus-labs/cortex` are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Upgrade pi-agent-core and pi-ai from `0.85.1` to `0.87.1`.
- Breaking: the system prompt and tool declarations now live in the transcript, as pi 0.87 requires. `agent.state.messages[0]` is a `role: 'system'` head (pi's `state.systemPrompt` is a read-only replay of it), slots move to positions `1..N`, and `ContextManager.historyStart` is where history begins. `getConversationHistory()` includes the `role: 'system'` messages pi and Cortex write inline for tool and prompt updates: persist them as returned (the observational watermark counts them) and skip them when rendering. `restoreConversationHistory()` replays them and the loop brings the prompt and tools up to date on its next request.
- Keep the prompt cache across mid-conversation changes. Once the model has answered, a prompt change goes out as a section patch and a tool change as a tool declaration, both as later system messages, leaving the cached head untouched on models that accept them; Anthropic models also get native `tool_addition`/`tool_removal` blocks, so connecting an MCP server, loading a skill's tools, or discovering a deferred tool no longer invalidates the cache. Other models collapse the updates into the head, as before. The prompt is written by pi's new `prepareRequest` hook before every request.
- Resolve prompt cache TTLs from the model's own lifetimes (pi-ai's `Model.promptCache`, exposed as `capabilities.promptCacheLifetimes`), falling back to `PROVIDER_CACHE_CONFIG`. Add `resolvePromptCacheTtlMs()`, and an optional lifetimes argument to `resolveCacheRetention()`.
- Add `capabilities.imageInput` (pi-ai's per-model image input limits). The Read tool refuses an image whose base64 encoding exceeds the current model's byte ceiling instead of sending a request the provider would reject.
- Add the Meta provider (Model API key and Muse subscription OAuth).
- Move `PRIMARY_MODEL_DEFAULTS` to the current catalog: `claude-sonnet-5`, `gpt-6-sol` (OpenAI and OpenAI Codex), `grok-4.7`, and `muse-spark-1.3` for Meta. The xAI default `grok-4` was no longer in the catalog.
- Port the native Ollama codec to pi-ai's transcript context: later system messages are collapsed into one leading prompt with the current tool set.

- Breaking: an omitted `CortexAgent` `mode` now resolves from the loops' backends. It is passthrough only when the talker and the reasoner would share one backend (same host and port) that is not served concurrently, with a `mode-resolved-passthrough` resolution note naming the backend and both models, and duplex otherwise. A native Ollama or custom-endpoint model whose talker runs on the same server defaults to passthrough; a talker pinned to another backend (a hosted model in front of an Ollama reasoner, or the reverse) runs duplex. Two distinct models on one serial Ollama server count as shared: set `parallelRequests: true` on both to opt in. An explicit `mode` always wins; `mode: 'duplex'` on such a shared backend adds a `duplex-not-concurrent` note, which `setModel()` also re-evaluates, and which a talker on another backend never earns.
- A passthrough agent's `mode-resolved-passthrough` note is re-read on `setModel()`: it names the new backend, or says the mode was fixed at creation when the new models would resolve to duplex (`data.wouldResolveTo`).
- Add `capabilities.concurrency` (`'parallel' | 'serial' | 'unknown'`, type `ModelConcurrency`) to every `CortexModel`: `parallel` for every provider in pi-ai's catalog (read at runtime, so providers a pi-ai release adds are covered), `serial` for `createOllamaModel()`, `unknown` for custom endpoints, provider ids pi-ai does not know, and any base URL on loopback, a private network or a private-use name such as `.local`.
- Add the optional `mode` field to the persisted `CortexAgentStateV2` artifact (the mode that wrote it) and a `restore-mode-mismatch` resolution note code. Restoring an artifact written in the other mode records the note and a lifecycle entry saying what was carried and what is inactive; a passthrough agent restoring a duplex artifact also takes the conversation the reasoner had not seen yet as silent context.
- Add the `flow_in_progress` `OAuthError` code. A second `initiateOAuth()` while one is running now rejects with it and leaves the first flow cancellable; previously it could orphan the first flow until its five-minute timeout. A `cancelOAuth()` during the callback-port check now stops the flow before any browser opens.
- Add `parallelRequests` to the Ollama model config, for servers that run requests in parallel (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` above 1, with the talker and reasoner models fitting in memory together).

## 0.6.0

- Add native local Ollama support through `ProviderManager.createOllamaModel()`, including runtime context allocation, thinking, structured output, and inference metrics. Requires Ollama `0.15.0` or newer.
- Honor small context budgets without the former 16K floor, share budget calculations across compaction strategies, and preserve Ollama prompt prefixes until context pressure requires trimming.
- Breaking: rename the former single-loop `CortexAgent` to `AgentLoop` and its configuration to `AgentLoopConfig`. `CortexAgent` now owns a composite agent with duplex talker/reasoner behavior by default; use `AgentLoop` for the prior primitive or `mode: 'passthrough'` for a single-loop facade.
- Breaking: remove the deprecated `systemPrompt` config, `buildSystemPrompt()`, and `rebuildSystemPrompt()` aliases. Use `initialBasePrompt` and the current prompt APIs. Facade persistence now uses composite `getState()`/`restore()` state; consult `docs/cortex/cortex-agent.md` before migrating.
- Add duplex routing, session logs, loop-origin metadata, permission coordination, and conversation/work settlement APIs.
- Build opt-in sandboxing into Cortex: `sandbox: true` provides managed setup, workspace defaults, shared network policy, in-process file protections, and automatic cleanup. Platform backends ship in this package, with an isolated runtime process per root agent on macOS/Linux. Strict enforcement is the default; `requireEnforcement: false` explicitly permits degraded operation.
- Upgrade pi-agent-core and pi-ai from the published `0.80.3` baseline to `0.85.1`; migrate OAuth to per-provider authentication and derive effort choices from model metadata.
- Fix credential scrubbing, internal-tool permission exemptions, prompt tool descriptions, and working-tag aliases and stream filtering.
- Add structured contexts (`slots`/`history`/`ephemeral`/`prompt`) to `directComplete()`, `structuredComplete()`, and `utilityComplete()`, applying the agentic loop's cache breakpoint strategy to direct calls.
- Add per-call `sessionId` override to direct completion options for cache affinity across distinct pipelines.
- Forward the agent's `cacheRetention` and `sessionId` on `utilityComplete()` calls (previously dropped).
- Fix BP3 cache breakpoint drift when conversation history contains consecutive tool results.
- Fix BP2 cache breakpoint loss when the last context slot is empty.
- Keep churning background task state outside the cached prefix by injecting it after ephemeral content and skill instructions.

## 0.5.0

- Upgrade pi packages to `0.80.3` and migrate away from relocated `pi-ai` exports.
- Add background retry with backoff and surface error cause chains.
- Fire `onLoopComplete` once per logical turn across background retries.
- Surface auth failures from direct completions through `onError`.
- Broaden auth error classification for OAuth expiry and refresh failures.
- Support aborting direct completions through `AbortSignal`.
- Wake the agent loop when a backgrounded Bash command completes.
