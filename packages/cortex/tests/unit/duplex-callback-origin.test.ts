/**
 * Fan-out callback origin: can a duplex consumer tell the two loops apart?
 *
 * A composite agent registers one consumer handler on several loops, so every
 * fan-out callback fires once per loop. That is correct (both loops really do
 * complete turns, retry, and compact), but until each carried a
 * LoopOriginContext the two arrivals were indistinguishable, and a consumer
 * could only render both: two retry countdowns for one provider hiccup, two
 * compaction notifications for one compaction, an onLoopComplete that did not
 * even say which loop had finished.
 *
 * These drive the REAL facade and the REAL loops, then assert the origin the
 * consumer actually receives. Asserting on what a registration helper does
 * with the handler would pass against wiring that never fires.
